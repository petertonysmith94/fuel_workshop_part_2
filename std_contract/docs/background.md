## Smart contract

- A **smart contract** is no different than a script or predicate in that it is a piece of bytecode that is deployed to the blockchain via a transaction.

- The main features of a smart contract that differentiate it from scripts or predicates are that it is **callable** and **stateful**. Put another way, a smart contract is analogous to a deployed API with some database state.
